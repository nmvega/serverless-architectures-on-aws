# serverless-architectures-on-aws
**python3** and **boto3** code re-implementation of a select, subset of chapters and examples in the Manning book:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Serverless Architectures on AWS**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://www.manning.com/books/serverless-architectures-on-aws

To work with these re-implementations, youll need a **python 3.6.x** interpreter installed, along with the following python libraries, which are available in the pip(1) repository:

1. awscli
2. boto3
3. botocore

You'll need to follow book instruction for setting up the various **AWS Lambda-functions** and **Microservices needed**; however you may substitute in python versions of the code, where they have been provided in this repository.

Development work was performed on **Linux** (specifically **Fedora-25/64 bit**) using the **Anaconda 4.3.1/64bit** distribution of **Python 3.6**. No development or testing was done on Windows.
